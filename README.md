### A Visual IDE for React Projects

Codux is an all-in-one visual development environment. Whether youâ€™re starting a new app, creating components, or editing an existing project, every visual change you make reflects instantly in the code and vice versa. To learn more about Codux, visit our website - [https://www.codux.com/](https://www.codux.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev).

It includes a single React component to start your project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Build the application in production mode into a folder named `dist`. This folder can be served using any HTTP server.

### `npm run dev`

Start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run preview`

Boots up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at [`http://localhost:4173`](http://localhost:4173) . It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

# Setup the App
The app is hosted at [work-time.theodorrisager.dk](https://work-time.theodorrisager.dk/).
In order to use it you have to setup a Google Sheet and a Google Apps Script, instructions for which are found below.

## Setup Google Sheets 
 1. Create a Google Sheet in Google Drive 
 2. Paste the following into the 'A1' cell
    - Replace `Activity 1` and `Activity 1` with names that fit your activities
    - If you want more activities, just add something to the upper right cell of each activity column e.g. 'G1'
``` 
Activity 1		0.00.00	Activity 2		0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00			0.00.00
Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End		Start	End	
``` 
 3. Copy the `SheetId` for use in the Google Apps Script
    - You find this in the url `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SheetId>/edit#gid=0`

 3. Change the name of the Sheet from e.g. `Sheet1` to `Data`
 4. Copy the contents of `google_apps_scripts/Code.gs` into the `Code.gs` file in Google Apps Script
 5. Setup `sheetId` property
    - Navigate to `Project Settings`
    - Press `Add script property`
    - Enter `sheetId` into `Property`
    - Enter the `SheetId` you copied in step 3 while setting up the Google Sheets into `Value`
    - Press `Save script properties`
 6. Deploy Apps Script
    - Press `Deploy`
    - Press `New Deployment`
    - Press `Select type` (Small gear, upper left)
